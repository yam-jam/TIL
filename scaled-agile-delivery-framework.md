# Scaled Agile Delivery Framework 
by Joanne Molesky

## Are we getting better?
- shared measures of performance
- ‎cross functional teams
- ‎fast feedback
- ‎shared goals 

#### Goals:
- Reduce waste 
- Delight customers 

#### Reducing cost is not reducing waste
- waste: e.g. reduce wait time, defects, resources not used
- ‎cost: measured in terms of no. of units e.g. manpower cost

#### GOALS
- what are we trying to achieve as an organisation through the work we do?
- ‎clearly articulated
- ‎stated from a customer perspective
- ‎everyone can fit their role into the goal
- ‎foundation for good decision making

#### Agile manifesto
- it's not that we don't do things on the right
- ‎given a fixed amount of time and resources, we value the things on the left over the right

#### Guiding principles
- one team
  - ‎Regardless if you're distributed
  - Treated on the same level
- ‎always on communication
- ‎focus on business value
  - ‎understand why you're doing it
  - ‎involves conversations with people in the business who understand what's going on
  - ‎fast feedback
    - ‎work only adds value when it's in the hands of the consumer
    - ‎continuous integration is not about using CI server or using Jenkins 
    - ‎how fast does an idea get into the customer's hands
    - ‎releases rarely goes past every 3 months
  - ‎measure performance and value
  - ‎culture of continuous improvement

#### Foundations and Team practices
- goal
- ‎definition of good
- ‎related operational metrics 

#### Roles and responsibilities
- executive/leadership
  - ‎goals
  - ‎principles/values
- ‎delivery management
  - ‎principles/values
  - ‎foundations
- ‎delivery team
  - ‎foundations
  - ‎practices

#### Measures and scorecards
 - telling a story of delivery value over time

#### Outputs vs outcomes
 ‎- output: the completed things produced
 ‎- outcomes: what happens to the things produced

#### Scorecards vs dashboard
- scorecards: picture of change over time
- ‎dashboard: indicator of status at any point in time

#### Delivery framework
- SLA compliance
- ‎technical/operational metrics
- ‎cost of release to production
- ‎# defects in production
- ‎mean time release to production
- ‎return on capital

Stop judging team performance based on how fast they can deliver features
- no correlation to value
  - ‎value is what does the customer value
    - increase revenue, sales?
 - ‎recommended book on measures: douglas hubbert how to measure everything
   - ‎min ppl to ask is 5

Dont target more than 2 to work on to improve
- best to work on 1 per iteration
- ‎when teams are allowed to set own targets and choose measures to use to help them, they often exceed their own expectations
- ‎use the 5 whys to get to the root cause of the problem and work on that
- ‎give ppl credit for the hard work they do

## Summary
-  everyine starts by doing agile
-  ‎learn from failure
-  ‎beware of your decision making biases
-  ‎measure to determine when change is required
-  ‎set criteria that triggers decision points to stop doing stuff 
-  ‎limit work in progress (wip)
-  ‎this is an art form, different circumstances require different approaches
-  ‎focus on the outcome of the work done

Think big. Start small. Learn fast.

Agile is adapting and changing to get better. It's not about going fast. Neither is lean.
